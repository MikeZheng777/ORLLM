Workout $X$ requires at least 15 hours a week and workout $Y$ needs at least 10 hours per week to ensure effectiveness. Each hour of workout $X$ costs 2 fatigue points, while each hour of workout $Y$ costs 3 fatigue points. Given these conditions, the coach aims to minimize the total fatigue points while meeting all constraints. What is the minimum total fatigue score possible for this schedule?
