These costs are:\n   - Week 1: \\$55, Week 2: \\$54, Week 3: \\$71, Week 4: \\$58, Week 5: \\$51, Week 6: \\$55, Week 7: \\$45, Week 8: \\$52, Week 9: \\$60, Week 10: \\$52, Week 11: \\$52, Week 12: \\$52, Week 13: \\$76, Week 14: \\$50, Week 15: \\$47, Week 16: \\$66, Week 17: \\$70, Week 18: \\$48, Week 19: \\$69.\n\n#### **Demand Constraints:**\n- The demand for each week must be met either by the inventory on hand, the units ordered in that week, or by backlogging to the next week. The demand for each week is as follows:\n  - Week 1: 495 units, Week 2: 316 units, Week 3: 375 units, Week 4: 467 units, Week 5: 418 units, Week 6: 398 units, Week 7: 533 units, Week 8: 525 units, Week 9: 361 units, Week 10: 452 units, Week 11: 470 units, Week 12: 378 units, Week 13: 302 units, Week 14: 463 units, Week 15: 438 units, Week 16: 383 units, Week 17: 377 units, Week 18: 429 units, Week 19: 324 units.\n\n#### **Inventory and Backlogging Rules:**\n- The inventory at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must be zero.\n- The backlogged demand at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must also be zero.\n- The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 19-week period (7,904 units) if an order is placed in that week.\n\n#### **Objective:**\nYour task is to determine the optimal ordering schedule, inventory levels, and backlogged amounts for each week to minimize the total cost, which includes fixed ordering costs, variable ordering costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs.\n\n#### **Key Decisions:**\n1. **Order Placement**: Decide whether to place an order in each week (a binary decision: yes or no).\n2. **Order Quantity**: Determine the number of units to order in each week.\n3. **Inventory Levels**: Decide how much inventory to hold at the end of each week.\n4. **Backlogged Demand**: Determine the amount of unmet demand to backlog to the next week.\n\nBy carefully balancing these decisions, you aim to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all customer demand is met either immediately or through backlogging.",

Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The processing times for each operation are as follows: Job 0 has Operation 0 (6 units), Operation 1 (8 units), and Operation 2 (9 units); Job 1 has Operation 0 (3 units), Operation 1 (8 units), Operation 2 (5 units), Operation 3 (5 units), and Operation 4 (2 units); Job 2 has Operation 0 (8 units), Operation 1 (1 unit), and Operation 2 (6 units); Job 3 has Operation 0 (1 unit), Operation 1 (9 units), Operation 2 (4 units), and Operation 3 (5 units).\n\nEach machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order of operations on the same machine is determined by binary decision variables. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on the same machine, the binary variable determines whether Operation 0 of Job 0 is processed before Operation 3 of Job 1 or vice versa. Similar constraints apply to other operation pairs on the same machine, such as Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3, and Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 3.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan, which must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0 is at least 6 units, so the makespan must be at least 6 units. Similarly, the completion time of Operation 1 of Job 0 is at least 8 units, so the makespan must be at least 8 units. This applies to all operations, with the final operation of Job 3 requiring at least 5 units.\n\nConstraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed, which takes at least 6 units. Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap, with binary variables determining the order of operations on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, and all start times for operations must be non-negative. Binary variables must be either 0 or 1, determining the order of operations on the same machine.\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints while minimizing the total time required to complete all jobs."

Each job must be processed on all four machines in sequence, and the facility must determine the optimal schedule to minimize the total production time. Each job has a unique processing time on each machine, as follows:\n\n- **Job 0**: 5 hours on Machine 0, 8 hours on Machine 1, 8 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 1**: 7 hours on Machine 0, 6 hours on Machine 1, 7 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 2**: 10 hours on Machine 0, 10 hours on Machine 1, 8 hours on Machine 2, and 7 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 3**: 7 hours on Machine 0, 10 hours on Machine 1, 5 hours on Machine 2, and 8 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 4**: 9 hours on Machine 0, 9 hours on Machine 1, 5 hours on Machine 2, and 6 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 5**: 6 hours on Machine 0, 9 hours on Machine 1, 6 hours on Machine 2, and 6 hours on Machine 3.\n\nThe facility must adhere to the following constraints:\n\n1. **One Job per Schedule Position**: Each of the six schedule positions (Position 0 through Position 5) must be assigned exactly one job. No two positions can have the same job.\n\n2. **One Schedule Position per Job**: Each job must be assigned to exactly one schedule position. No job can be assigned to multiple positions.\n\n3. **Machine Precedence**: The processing of a job on Machine 1 cannot start until it has completed processing on Machine 0. Similarly, processing on Machine 2 cannot begin until the job has finished on Machine 1, and processing on Machine 3 cannot start until the job has completed on Machine 2.\n\n4. **Job Precedence**: The processing of a job in a later schedule position cannot start on any machine until the job in the previous position has completed its processing on that machine. For example, if Job 0 is in Position 0 and Job 1 is in Position 1, Job 1 cannot start on Machine 0 until Job 0 has finished its processing on Machine 0.\n\nThe objective is to determine the optimal schedule for processing the six jobs across the four machines to minimize the total production time, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. The total production time is defined as the time when the last job completes its processing on Machine 3, plus any additional processing time required for the last job in the schedule."

Each job has a unique processing time on each machine, as follows:\n\n- **Job 0**: 5 hours on Machine 0, 8 hours on Machine 1, 8 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 1**: 7 hours on Machine 0, 6 hours on Machine 1, 7 hours on Machine 2, and 5 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 2**: 10 hours on Machine 0, 10 hours on Machine 1, 8 hours on Machine 2, and 7 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 3**: 7 hours on Machine 0, 10 hours on Machine 1, 5 hours on Machine 2, and 8 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 4**: 9 hours on Machine 0, 9 hours on Machine 1, 5 hours on Machine 2, and 6 hours on Machine 3.\n- **Job 5**: 6 hours on Machine 0, 9 hours on Machine 1, 6 hours on Machine 2, and 6 hours on Machine 3.\n\nThe facility must adhere to the following constraints:\n\n1. **One Job per Schedule Position**: Each of the six schedule positions (Position 0 through Position 5) must be assigned exactly one job. No two positions can have the same job.\n\n2. **One Schedule Position per Job**: Each job must be assigned to exactly one schedule position. No job can be assigned to multiple positions.\n\n3. **Machine Precedence**: The processing of a job on Machine 1 cannot start until it has completed processing on Machine 0. Similarly, processing on Machine 2 cannot begin until the job has finished on Machine 1, and processing on Machine 3 cannot start until the job has completed on Machine 2.\n\n4. **Job Precedence**: The processing of a job in a later schedule position cannot start on any machine until the job in the previous position has completed its processing on that machine. For example, if Job 0 is in Position 0 and Job 1 is in Position 1, Job 1 cannot start on Machine 0 until Job 0 has finished its processing on Machine 0.\n\nThe objective is to determine the optimal schedule for processing the six jobs across the four machines to minimize the total production time, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. The total production time is defined as the time when the last job completes its processing on Machine 3, plus any additional processing time required for the last job in the schedule.",

There are two restaurants, each with two shifts per day, and eight employees available for assignment. Each shift at each restaurant has specific staffing demands for a particular skill, and employees have varying availability and skill sets. Employees can only be assigned to shifts they are available for and to roles that match their skills. Each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants. Assigning employees to shifts incurs specific costs: assigning Employee 0 to Skill 0 costs 1 unit, assigning Employee 3 to Skill 0 costs 2 units, and assigning Employee 4 to Skill 0 costs 3 units.

    "description": "The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to minimize costs associated with unfulfilled positions and employee assignments. There are two restaurants, each with two shifts per day, and eight employees available for assignment. Each shift at each restaurant has specific staffing demands for a particular skill, and employees have varying availability and skill sets. Employees can only be assigned to shifts they are available for and to roles that match their skills. Each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants. Assigning employees to shifts incurs specific costs: assigning Employee 0 to Skill 0 costs 1 unit, assigning Employee 3 to Skill 0 costs 2 units, and assigning Employee 4 to Skill 0 costs 3 units. If a restaurant cannot meet the demand for a specific skill in a shift, unfulfilled positions incur a penalty cost of 100 units per position.

The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area. The populations of the areas range from 2,010 to 4,970 people, with the total population across all areas being a critical factor in your decision-making.\n\n2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.\n\n3. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. For example, Area 0 can be covered if any of Towers 0, 2, 5, 6, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, or 27 are built. Similar coverage relationships exist for all 32 areas.\n\n4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.\n\n5. **Decision Variables**:\n   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).\n   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built. For example, Area 1 can only be covered if at least one of Towers 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, or 28 is built.\n\n2. **Budget Limit**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This requires careful selection of towers to balance coverage and cost.\n\n3. **Binary Decisions**: Both the decision to build a tower and the decision to cover an area are binary (yes or no). You cannot partially build a tower or partially cover an area.\n\n#### Numerical Parameters:\n- **Population Sizes**: The populations of the 32 areas are as follows:\n  - Area 0: 2,285\n  - Area 1: 3,023\n  - Area 2: 3,557\n  - Area 3: 3,938\n  - Area 4: 3,689\n  - Area 5: 2,426\n  - Area 6: 4,697\n  - Area 7: 3,214\n  - Area 8: 2,580\n  - Area 9: 2,010\n  - Area 10: 3,180\n  - Area 11: 4,083\n  - Area 12: 2,787\n  - Area 13: 3,095\n  - Area 14: 2,898\n  - Area 15: 4,374\n  - Area 16: 4,970\n  - Area 17: 3,689\n  - Area 18: 4,612\n  - Area 19: 3,232\n  - Area 20: 4,177\n  - Area 21: 2,211\n  - Area 22: 3,123\n  - Area 23: 4,194\n  - Area 24: 3,774\n  - Area 25: 3,391\n  - Area 26: 3,959\n  - Area 27: 3,010\n  - Area 28: 3,213\n  - Area 29: 3,106\n  - Area 30: 2,652\n  - Area 31: 3,441\n\n- **Tower Costs**: The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:\n  - Tower 0: 323 units\n  - Tower 1: 210 units\n  - Tower 2: 360 units\n  - Tower 3: 480 units\n  - Tower 4: 375 units\n  - Tower 5: 491 units\n  - Tower 6: 498 units\n  - Tower 7: 267 units\n  - Tower 8: 413 units\n  - Tower 9: 417 units\n  - Tower 10: 291 units\n  - Tower 11: 388 units\n  - Tower 12: 284 units\n  - Tower 13: 463 units\n  - Tower 14: 309 units\n  - Tower 15: 382 units\n  - Tower 16: 476 units\n  - Tower 17: 325 units\n  - Tower 18: 428 units\n  - Tower 19: 265 units\n  - Tower 20: 323 units\n  - Tower 21: 282 units\n  - Tower 22: 441 units\n  - Tower 23: 467 units\n  - Tower 24: 491 units\n  - Tower 25: 232 units\n  - Tower 26: 396 units\n  - Tower 27: 370 units\n  - Tower 28: 309 units\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to select which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget of 3,226 units.
